# Docker
Learn basics of Docker and build distributed systems using containers.

# Basics
1. [Install the docker and run the hello world application](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Install%20the%20docker%20and%20run%20the%20hello%20world%20application.md)
2. [Run the basic nginx web server example](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Run%20the%20basic%20nginx%20web%20server.md)
4. [Create a simple greeting web application using flask](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Create%20a%20simple%20greeting%20web%20application%20using%20flask.md)
5. [Run the simple greeting web application inside the container](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Run%20the%20simple%20greeting%20web%20application%20inside%20the%20container.md)
6. [Register to docker hub](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Register%20to%20DockerHub.md)
7. [Containerize the web application : Create and build the dockerfile for web application](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Create%20and%20build%20the%20dockerfile%20for%20web%20application.md)

Now you should be able to understand containers, Dockerfile, build an image from a Dockerfile and understand layers, tag and push images to a registry.

1. [Pass parameters to the Application using environment variables](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Pass%20parameters%20to%20the%20Application%20using%20environment%20variables.md)
2. [Introduction to Redis cache database](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Redis%20cache%20database.md)
3. [Create dynamic web application which connects with redis installed on ubuntu os](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Create%20dynamic%20web%20application%20which%20connects%20with%20redis%20installed%20on%20ubuntu%20os.md)
4. [Create a dynamic web application which connects with the redis container](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Create%20a%20dynamic%20web%20application%20which%20connects%20with%20the%20redis%20container.md)
5. [Create a dynamic web application in a container which connects with the redis container](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Create%20a%20dynamic%20web%20application%20in%20a%20container%20which%20connects%20with%20the%20redis%20container.md)
6. [Connect container web application with redis container using its name](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Connect%20container%20web%20application%20with%20redis%20container%20using%20its%20name.md)
7. [Package the web application and Redis database using docker compose](https://github.com/ShrddhaRana/DockerBasics/blob/main/Connect%20container%20web%20application%20with%20redis%20container%20using%20its%20name.md)

Now you should be able to understand, using environment variables in the docker, connecting multiple docker using  docker networking, and  docker compose.
